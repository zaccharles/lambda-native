# Change Log

#### Fixed AWS Lambda Connection Timeout

After the invocating first time (Cold Start) and then waiting for 100 seconds its get error message because of AWS Lambda has default connection timeout at 100 seconds (reference https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-function-retry-timeout-sdk/)

# Usage

To use LambdaNative in your own project, please see the README in the [example](example) directory. 

# How It Works

At the end of 2018, AWS [announced](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/aws-lambda-now-supports-custom-runtimes-and-layers/) Custom Runtimes and the Runtime API that enables them. In a nutshell, you select Custom Runtime and provide an executable named file `bootstrap` (in your ZIP file) which AWS Lambda will execute instead of its own. You're then responsible for interacting with an HTTP API to get executions, running handler code, and reporting the result or any errors back to the API.  

LambdaNative is a library that handles all the API interaction and error handling for you. All you need to do is tell it which handler to execute by implementing an interface and calling `LambdaNative.Run`.

You can then use [CoreRT](https://github.com/dotnet/corert) to perform ahead of time compilation, producing a native executable that doesn't require any runtime compilation.

Below is a comparison between a standard function and one running under LambdaNative. The function deserialies a request object, writes to DynamoDB, publishes an SNS message, and returns a response object.
